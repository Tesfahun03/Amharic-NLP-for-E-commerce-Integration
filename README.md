### EthioMart-LLM-Finetuning: Amharic NLP for E-commerce Integration  

This repository contains the development and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) to support EthioMart’s vision of becoming the central hub for Telegram-based e-commerce in Ethiopia.  

The project addresses challenges in decentralized e-commerce by:  
- Extracting key business entities such as product names, prices, and locations from text, images, and documents shared across Telegram channels.  
- Populating EthioMart's centralized database with real-time, structured data to create a seamless, unified platform for customers and vendors.  

### Key Features:  
- **Fine-tuned NLP Models**: Tailored LLMs optimized for Amharic NER tasks.  
- **Multimodal Data Processing**: Extracts entities from text, images, and documents.  
- **Real-Time Data Consolidation**: Centralizes data from multiple e-commerce Telegram channels.  
- **E-commerce Focus**: Enables seamless product discovery, order placement, and vendor interaction.  

This repository showcases advanced techniques in natural language processing, particularly fine-tuning transformer models for low-resource languages like Amharic, and demonstrates their application in real-world e-commerce scenarios.  

### Tech Stack:  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, SpaCy  
- **Models**: BERT, mT5, or other Amharic-supporting architectures  

### Use Cases:  
- E-commerce platform enhancement  
- Named Entity Recognition for low-resource languages  
- Real-time data integration
